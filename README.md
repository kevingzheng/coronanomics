# Coronanomics
#### Authors: Pratheek Hegde & Kevin Zheng
## Goals
Coronanomics is a webpage that aggregates and visualizes a variety of different economic data. It aims to provide insight into how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will affect the world economy in the short- and long-run. While some countries have already entered recessions due to the pandemic, it is still unclear if these "recessions" will be drawn out or if the world economy will quickly bounce back. The goals of Coronanomics are to: 
* Make economic data easily accessible and understandable
* Visualize the impact of the virus on global livelihoods

## Technologies
Coronanomics is written primarily in Javascript with HTML5/CSS, using jQuery, Bootstrap, and D3.js for data visualization and display. Data formatting scripts are written in Python 3 and C++, and Makefiles are used to clean up and automate data retrieval/re-formatting.
